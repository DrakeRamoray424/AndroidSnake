This is the repository for the Android Snake App developed by Neil Nelanuthala for CS 4200.

Please excuse the current format of the layout and java files as I was unable to upload my zipped project due to the file size being bigger than that which GitHub allows.

I would recommend importing each of the subfolders as they are into a new Android Studio project. It is most likely necessary to rename the references (based on the folder hierarchy) to the classes invoked within each activity.

I placed the .mp3 files in within res/raw/ in my project, so I would recommend you do the same to get the music working for the game.

Lastly, the "Activity_Score_List_Horizontal.xml" file doesn't display the scoreboard information properly and is therefore never actually invoked or referenced in any of the other files.
