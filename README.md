This is the repository for the Android Snake App developed by Neil Nelanuthala for CS 4200.

Please excuse the current format of the layout and java files. I've actually uploaded my zipped "app/src" folder which contains all of these files already but I can't be sure how time consuming and frustrating it might be to import my code into a new project.

If unzipping the src folder doesnt work for some reason:

I would recommend importing each of the subfolders as they are into a new Android Studio project. It is most likely necessary to rename the references (based on the folder hierarchy) to the classes invoked within each activity.

I placed the .mp3 files in within res/raw/ in my project, so I would recommend you do the same to get the music working for the game.

Lastly, the "Activity_Score_List_Horizontal.xml" file doesn't display the scoreboard information properly and is therefore never actually invoked or referenced in any of the other files.
